1. In this application there are three folders i)BusinessLogic ii)DAL iii)Models

Business logic-> The main business logic behind the application.

DAL-> Data layer for all database-related communications

Models-> User inputs and validation.

This way of splitting the files is helpful for more readability and it's easier to reuse the code.

2. I have used the extension method to create an addition method as per instructions. Basically, this extension method helps to extend the functionality of the old class even if we don't

have access to the specific code. It largely helps to enhance the class designs, gives good readability also loosely coupled that's why I have used extension methods in addition and input classes.

3. In this application my goal is to add the two numbers, display the result, save the numbers in the database and display all saved results into the user so I choose "double" datatype to cover all types of numbers.

4. I have used try catch to handle the exceptions and also used serilog to log the error in a file(Additionapp.log). Logging the error helps to troubleshoot the problem easily.

5. I have used MSTest unit tests to test the extension and input methods.

6. I have used a Microsoft SQL server as a data repository. My database contains 2 tables one is to store the values and one is for the error log.

7. I have used stored procedures to save and retrieve list process because stored procedure gives data security and it improves the performance as well.
